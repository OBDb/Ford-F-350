generations:
  - name: "F-Series Super Duty First Generation"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The first-generation Super Duty F-350 established Ford's dedicated heavy-duty truck platform separate from the F-150 line. Available in single rear wheel (SRW) or dual rear wheel (DRW) configurations, and in Regular Cab, SuperCab, or Crew Cab body styles with various bed options, it was designed for maximum capability. The distinctive exterior featured a bold front end with a massive grille and prominent fender flares on DRW models. Engine options included a 5.4L Triton V8, 6.8L Triton V10, and the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel (replaced by a 6.0L Power Stroke in 2003). Transmission choices included manual and automatic options, with four-wheel drive available across the range. The F-350's chassis was significantly reinforced compared to lighter-duty Ford trucks, with heavier suspension components, larger brakes, and a more robust frame. This generation set new standards for heavy-duty truck capability while offering comfort and features that made these work-focused vehicles more practical for everyday use."

  - name: "F-Series Super Duty Second Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The second-generation Super Duty F-350 featured revised styling with a larger, more prominent grille and enhanced aerodynamics. The fully boxed frame was significantly strengthened, improving towing and payload capacities. Engine options continued with the 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 gasoline engines, while the diesel option transitioned to the 6.4L Power Stroke with better emissions control and performance. The interior received notable improvements in design and quality, particularly in higher trim levels such as Lariat and King Ranch. New technology features included an integrated trailer brake controller and updated audio systems with available navigation. Despite its short production run, this generation continued Ford's strong position in the heavy-duty truck market while addressing increasingly stringent emissions requirements for diesel engines."

  - name: "F-Series Super Duty Third Generation"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The third-generation Super Duty F-350 introduced Ford's all-new 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, designed and manufactured in-house rather than sourced from Navistar. This new diesel offered improved power, torque, and reliability along with better fuel efficiency and quieter operation. Gasoline options evolved to a 6.2L V8 replacing the previous 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10. The exterior design featured a larger grille and more pronounced styling elements emphasizing its heavy-duty capabilities. The interior continued to advance with improved materials, design, and technology, including SYNC infotainment systems. Towing and payload capacities increased significantly, maintaining Ford's competitive position in the capability-focused heavy-duty segment. Special editions included the luxury-oriented Platinum trim and specialized chassis packages for commercial applications."

  - name: "F-Series Super Duty Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The fourth-generation Super Duty F-350 adopted aluminum body construction similar to the F-150, reducing weight while allowing for reinvestment in stronger components for improved capability. The fully boxed frame used high-strength steel for increased rigidity and durability. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel received substantial updates, eventually reaching 475 HP and 1,050 lb-ft of torque in later model years. The 6.2L gasoline V8 continued as the standard engine, with a 7.3L gasoline V8 added in 2020 as a middle option. The interior offered premium appointments in higher trims along with advanced technology including SYNC 3, driver assistance features, and comprehensive towing aids. This generation established new benchmarks for capability while offering unprecedented levels of technology and refinement in the heavy-duty truck segment."

    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Super Duty F-350 features evolutionary styling updates with functional improvements including enhanced lighting, more convenient bed access, and better aerodynamics. Powertrain options include a standard 6.8L V8 (replacing the 6.2L), optional 7.3L Godzilla V8, updated 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, and a new high-output diesel version producing 500 HP and 1,200 lb-ft of torque. All engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The strengthened chassis enables class-leading towing and payload capacities, with properly configured F-350 DRW models capable of towing over 35,000 pounds. The interior features significant technology updates including a 12-inch digital instrument cluster, 12-inch center touchscreen with SYNC 4, and a customizable 2-inch productivity screen. Advanced features include Pro Trailer Hitch Assist, trailer navigation, and embedded 5G connectivity. This generation continues the Super Duty tradition of maximum capability while incorporating modern technology to improve productivity, comfort, and safety for both commercial and personal use."
